# speclock — Spec

speclock's own spec, tracked with speclock. Each criterion below is covered by
tests tagged with its id (e.g. `[SL-2]`). `speclock check` runs the suite and
gates on this file — the project eats its own dog food.

## Overview

A CLI that turns a written spec into machine-checkable acceptance criteria,
maps each criterion to tests, and gates merges on whether those tests exist and
pass. Pure core, thin CLI shell, pluggable test-runner adapters.

## Acceptance Criteria

### SL-1: `speclock init` scaffolds a SPEC.md template

Running `init` writes a SPEC.md template and refuses to overwrite an existing
file unless `--force` is given.

### SL-2: speclock parses a SPEC.md into acceptance criteria

The parser reads `### <id>: <description>` headings under "## Acceptance
Criteria", ignores fenced code, derives ids when absent, and rejects duplicates.

### SL-3: `speclock plan` locks criteria into specs/*.yaml

`plan` writes a YAML lock and, on re-run, preserves hand-added `tests:` mappings
while syncing descriptions and dropping criteria no longer in the spec.

### SL-4: the resolver maps criteria to tests

A criterion is covered by any test whose name contains its `[id]` tag or an
explicit substring from the lock. Coverage state is tested / failing / untested.

### SL-5: `speclock check` gates on the spec

`check` fails (non-zero) unless every criterion maps to at least one passing
test and the suite itself is green.

### SL-6: a Vitest adapter runs the suite

The Vitest adapter runs `vitest run` and normalizes its JSON report into a
runner-agnostic result of pass/fail/skip per test.

### SL-7: `speclock status` prints a coverage map

`status` prints each criterion as ✅ tested / 🚧 failing / ❌ untested with a
summary, without failing the process.

### SL-8: the core is pure

Everything under `src/core` is free of filesystem, child-process, and process
I/O, so the heart of speclock is fully unit-testable.

### SL-9: speclock only writes spec and lock files

Writes are confined to a markdown spec (`init`) and a YAML lock under `specs/`
(`plan`), always inside the project. A stray `--spec`/`--out` can never clobber a
user's source or tests, or escape the project directory.

### SL-10: a Jest adapter runs the suite

The Jest adapter runs `jest --json` and normalizes its (Jest-compatible) report
into the same runner-agnostic pass/fail/skip result, sharing the pure parser
with the Vitest adapter. Selected with `speclock check --runner jest`.

### SL-11: a pytest adapter runs the suite

The pytest adapter runs `pytest --junit-xml` and parses the JUnit XML into the
same runner-agnostic pass/fail/skip result with a small pure parser. Selected
with `speclock check --runner pytest`.

### SL-12: `speclock check --json` emits a machine-readable report

With `--json`, `check` prints one JSON object (stable `schemaVersion`) on stdout
carrying the gate verdict, per-criterion coverage, suite info, and problems —
diagnostics stay on stderr and the exit code is unchanged.

### SL-13: `speclock status --json` emits a machine-readable report

With `--json`, `status` prints one JSON object on stdout with the same coverage
schema (no gate verdict), for PR bots and tooling.

### SL-14: speclock is publish-ready as `speclock-cli`

The package publishes under the name `speclock-cli` with a `speclock` bin, ships
`dist`, declares a semver version and a Node engine, and builds via the
`prepare`/`prepublishOnly` hooks — so `npm pack` + install runs the CLI.

### SL-15: a reusable GitHub Action gates a project on `speclock check`

speclock ships a composite Action (`action.yml`) that others drop into a
workflow to run `speclock check`, exposing `runner`/`dir`/`working-directory`
inputs and invoking the built CLI. speclock's own CI dogfoods it.

### SL-16: criteria are aggregated across all lock files in a directory

`check`/`status` read every `*.yaml`/`*.yml` lock in the directory, union their
criteria, and reject a criterion id that appears in more than one file.

### SL-17: an unknown runner is rejected with the available runners listed

Selecting a `--runner` that has no adapter fails as a usage error (exit 2) with a
message naming the adapters that are available.

### SL-18: `check` returns honest exit codes

`check` exits `0` when every criterion is tested, `1` when a criterion is
untested/failing or the suite is red, and `2` for a usage/config error — the
ambiguous case always resolves to failure, never a false green.

### SL-19: output color is injected and disables cleanly

Human output is colored through an injectable palette, so the same renderers
produce plain text when color is off (`NO_COLOR`, non-TTY) and ANSI when it's on.

### SL-20: `speclock status` never fails the build

`status` is informational: it reports coverage and always exits `0` on success,
even when criteria are untested or failing, so it's safe to run anywhere.

### SL-21: the lock file is versioned and schema-validated

A lock is a versioned mapping of criteria; `plan`/`check` reject a malformed lock
(non-mapping, missing id, duplicate ids, non-string fields) or a version newer
than this speclock supports, rather than silently misbehaving.

## Out of Scope

- Adapters beyond Vitest/Jest/pytest (`go test` and others ship later; the
  interface is ready).
- Modifying user source or tests (speclock only writes SPEC.md and specs/).
- Network access or telemetry of any kind.
